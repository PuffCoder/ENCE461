\chapter{Introduction}

This guide is written in the hope that it will ease your introduction
into building, programming, and troubleshooting an embedded system.
Making embedded systems is not easy; you have to get a lot right.  One
incorrect bit can be the difference between a working and a
non-working system.

If you find things a little Linux-centric, well that's the only
operating system I've run for over twenty-five years.  It is a common
operating system for many high-end embedded systems; it runs on
Android phones and probably on your internet router.  And, yeah, I
like the command-line; it is faster than using a mouse and GUI.
