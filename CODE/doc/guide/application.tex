\chapter{Application}


Here are my recommendations for your Hat or Racer application:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Build and test your programs incrementally.

\item Write separate test programs that you can run when your
  application fails to work.  When debugging embedded systems, it is
  much easier to use a small test program rather than a large
  application.

\item It is easier to use a paced loop and poll the peripherals than
  using interrupts.

\item Disable the \hyperref[watchdog-timer]{watchdog timer} until you
  have robust code.
  
\end{enumerate}
