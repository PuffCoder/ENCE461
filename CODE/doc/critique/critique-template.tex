\section{Peer assessment}

\comment{There are two assessments to fill into the table}:
\begin{description}
  \item [\comment{My board}] \comment{Here you assess you and your
    partner's contributions to your board.  Usually, you will only
    have two names in this section except for groups of five students
    where there may be three names.}

  \item [\comment{Whole system}] \comment{Here you assess you and your
    team members' contribution to the whole system (group
    coordination, chassis, dastardly stuff, system integration, work
    on other boards, etc.).}
\end{description}
